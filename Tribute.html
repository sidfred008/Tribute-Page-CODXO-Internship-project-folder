                    <td><p class = "intro-paragraph"><strong><i><a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg" target = "_blank">Mark Elliot Zuckerberg</a></i></strong> is an American businessman. He co-founded the social media service Facebook, along with his Harvard roommates in 2004, and its parent company Meta Platforms (formerly Facebook, Inc.), of which he is chairman, chief executive officer and controlling shareholder.
                    Zuckerberg briefly attended Harvard University, where he launched Facebook in February 2004 with his roommates Eduardo Saverin, Andrew McCollum, Dustin Moskovitz and Chris Hughes. Zuckerberg took the company public in May 2012 with majority shares. In 2008, at age 23, he became the world's youngest self-made billionaire. He has since used his funds to organize multiple donations, including the establishment of the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative. His net worth as of June 13, 2024 is USD $176 billion, making him the fourth richest person in the world, behind Elon Musk, Bernard Arnault, and Jeff Bezos.
                    He was born on May 14 in the year 1984 in White Plains, New York to psychiatrist Karen and dentist Edward Zuckerberg. He has three sisters named Arielle, Randi and Donna and they all grew up together in a reformed Jewish household.<br><br>Zuckerberg began using computers and writing software in middle school. In high school, he built a program that allowed all the computers between his house and his father's dental office to communicate with each other.During Zuckerberg's high-school years, he worked to build a music player called the Synapse Media Player. The device used machine learning to learn the user's listening habits, which was posted to Slashdo
                    and received a rating of 3 out of 5 from PC Magazine. While still in high school, he attended Mercy College taking a graduate computer course on Thursday evenings.</p></td>

        <h2 class = "header2"><i>Education and Career</i></h2>

        <p class = "para2">The New Yorker noted that by the time Zuckerberg began classes at Harvard in 2002, he had already achieved a "reputation as a programming prodigy". He studied psychology and computer science, resided in Kirkland House,and belonged to Alpha Epsilon Pi. In his second year, he wrote a program that he called CourseMatch, which allowed users to make class selection decisions based on the choices of other students and help them form study groups.
        Later, he created a different program he initially called Facemash that let students select the best-looking person from a choice of photos. Arie Hasit, Zuckerberg's roommate at the time, explained:

        <br><br><p class = "statement">We had books called Face Books, which included the names and pictures of everyone who lived in the student dorms. At first, he built a site and placed two pictures or pictures of two males and two females. Visitors to the site had to choose who was "hotter" and according to the votes there would be a ranking.</p><br>
        <p class = "para3">In January 2004, Zuckerberg began writing code for a new website. On February 4, 2004, Zuckerberg launched "Thefacebook", originally located at thefacebook.com, in partnership with his roommates Eduardo Saverin, Andrew McCollum, Dustin Moskovitz, and Chris Hughes.
        An earlier inspiration for Facebook may have come from Phillips Exeter Academy, the prep school from which Zuckerberg graduated in 2002. It published its own student directory, "The Photo Address Book", which students referred to as "The Facebook". Such photo directories were an important part of the student social experience at many private schools. With them, students were able to list attributes such as their class years, their friends, and their telephone numbers.</p>

                <td><p class = "para4">Six days after the site launched, three Harvard seniors, Cameron Winklevoss, Tyler Winklevoss, and Divya Narendra, accused Zuckerberg of intentionally misleading them into believing that he would help them build a social network called HarvardConnection.com, when he was using their ideas to build a competing product.
                    The three complained to The Harvard Crimson, and the newspaper began an investigation in response. While Zuckerberg tried to convince the editors not to run the story,
                    he also broke into two of the editors' email accountsâ€”for which he made use of their private login data logs from TheFacebook.<br><br>
                    Following the official launch of the Facebook social media platform, the three filed a lawsuit against Zuckerberg that resulted in a settlement. The agreed settlement was for 1.2 million Facebook shares and $20 million in cash.<br><br>
                    Zuckerberg's Facebook started off as just a "Harvard thing" until he decided to spread it to other schools, enlisting the help of roommate and co-founder Dustin Moskovitz.
                    They began with Columbia University, New York University, Stanford University, Dartmouth College, Cornell University, University of Pennsylvania, Brown University, and Yale University.</p></td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <p class = "para5">Zuckerberg dropped out of Harvard in his sophomore year in order to complete the project. Zuckerberg, Moskovitz and the other co-founders moved to Palo Alto, California, where they leased a small house that served as an office. Over the summer, Zuckerberg met Peter Thiel, who invested in his company. They got their first office in mid-2004. According to Zuckerberg, the group planned to return to Harvard, but eventually decided to remain in California, where Zuckerberg appreciated the "mythical place" of Silicon Valley, the center of computer technology in California.
        They had already turned down offers by major corporations to buy the company. In an interview in 2007, Zuckerberg explained his reasoning: "It's not because of the amount of money. For me and my colleagues, the most important thing is that we create an open information flow for people. Having media corporations owned by conglomerates is just not an attractive idea to me."
        The same year, speaking at Y Combinator's Startup School course at Stanford University, Zuckerberg made a controversial assertion that "young people are just smarter" and that other entrepreneurs should bias towards hiring young people.</p><hr>

        <h2 class = "header3"><i>Personal Life</i></h2>
            <p class = "para6">Zuckerberg met fellow Harvard student Priscilla Chan at a frat party during his sophomore year with whom he began dating in 2003.
            In September 2010, Chan, who was a medical student at the University of California, San Francisco at the time, moved into his rented house in Palo Alto, California.
            They married on May 19, 2012, in the grounds of his mansion in an event that also celebrated her graduation from medical school.<br><br>
            Zuckerberg revealed on July 31, 2015, that they were expecting a baby girl and that Chan had previously experienced three miscarriages.<br><br>
            Time named Zuckerberg one of the most influential people in the world in 2008, 2011, 2016 and 2019, and nominated him as a finalist several other times. He was named the Time Person of the Year in 2010, the same year when Facebook eclipsed more than half a billion users.
            In December 2016, Zuckerberg was ranked tenth on the Forbes list of the World's Most Powerful People.<br><br>
            Raised as a Reform Jew, Zuckerberg later identified as an atheist. However, he said in 2016 that "I went through a period where I questioned things, but now I believe religion is very important."</p><hr>
        <h2 class = "Header4"><i>My Personal Tribute</i></h2>
            <p class = "para7">I especially dedicate this project to this person who has been one of my inspirations and got me into this field of computer science, web development and cybersecurity.
            One of the best creative minds during those days which has resulted him to become the 4th richest person in the world, I look up to the hard work and dedication that he had regarding 
            Facebook's development and above all how interesting it is that now because of such a revolution, we can easily contact with one another ( although social media has it's own cons as well ) but 
            I look up to this one story and motivate me to study and work hard in my area and bloom in this field by conntributing in it as a service.</p><hr>
